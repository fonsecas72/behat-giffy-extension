# Giffy - behat-giffy-extension

This is a behat extension/driver that will save screenshots in each interaction with the browser.
Just enable it (add it to your session group) and add a `@giffy` tag to your feature/scenario and your done.
You can also use as your default session (javascript maybe) but it will do a lot of work.

It works on top of selenium2 driver and of course, you can only use with it. At least for now.
