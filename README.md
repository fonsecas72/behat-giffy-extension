# Giffy - behat-giffy-extension

Behat extension that generates an animated gif with the complete interaction of tagged scenarios

This extension adds a driver that will allow you  to create a animated GIF based on saved screenshots for each interaction with the browser.

Enable it by adding it to your session group and by adding a `@giffy` tag to your feature/scenario.

You can also use as your default session (javascript maybe) but be aware that it will slow down your tests.

**It works on top of selenium2**
